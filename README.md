### Year-Round Conclusion
The June and December summary statistics have maximum temperatures of 85° and 83° respectively. This shows that the weather will support a surf and ice cream shop year-round. 

## Summary 
While the temperature leads us to assume that surfing and eating ice cream are possible year-round, investigating the potential impact of rain and travel season would be beneficial. Looking at hotel occupancy rates could help us in finding out when Oahu is busiest. Having that information could be useful when looking at staffing needs for different parts of the year. To determine the potential impact of rain, we can query the weather data for June and December precipitation statistics. After doing so, precipitation does not look like a consistent threat in either month though it does rain more in December than it does in June. The summaries of the precipitation data for both months are below:
